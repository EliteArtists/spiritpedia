Spiritpedia

A spiritual encyclopedia for the modern age — uniting timeless wisdom with personalised, AI-powered tools to help humans raise their vibration, find healing, and live in harmony.

⸻

🌌 Vision

Spiritpedia is not just a content hub or search engine — it’s a personalised spiritual companion, designed to evolve with each user’s unique path.
	•	Visitors can explore freely (via search, quotes, and trending content)
	•	Registered users unlock a fully immersive experience: saved content, AI notifications, tracked progress, and a curated journey of healing and expansion.

⸻

🧭 Core Philosophy

“Don’t show them everything. Show them exactly what they need.”

Spiritpedia isn’t about information overload — it’s about calm, resonance, and alignment.
It meets users exactly where they are, emotionally and spiritually, and gently supports their next step in evolution.

🪶 Modular Dashboard (User Sanctuary)

Each user has a personal dashboard — their private, intelligent library of the soul.

Sections include:
	•	📘 Saved Books – organised into smart folders (Law of Attraction, Spiritual Classics, etc.)
	•	🎥 Saved Videos – sorted by teacher or discipline
	•	💬 Quotes & Affirmations – favourites tagged by emotion
	•	🧘 Practices & Disciplines – a visual log of explored modalities
	•	🧭 Journey Timeline – highlights new learnings or emotional patterns over time
	•	🔔 IAM Notification Controls – manage affirmation frequency and themes
	•	📈 Optional Progress Insights – time spent reading, viewing, or journaling

The dashboard is designed like a spiritual Netflix meets Notion — calming, modular, and personal.

⸻

🧠 Content Tagging & Filter System

All content is tagged within Supabase to power personalised discovery.

Tag Categories:
	•	Primary Subject (e.g. “Reiki”)
	•	Emotional Tone (e.g. “Healing,” “Surrender,” “Hope”)
	•	Format (Book, Video, Quote, Healer, Practice)
	•	Depth Level (Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced)

AI assistance (via Gemini/Claude) can auto‑suggest tags on upload.
Users never see complex tag clouds — instead, they explore through guided prompts like:

“How are you feeling today?” → “Lost” → Suggested videos, books, and quotes appear instantly.

Would you like me to now:
	•	add a small “App Architecture Overview” (how all these modules connect technically — useful before we plan the backend),
or
	•	go straight into the backend setup discussion you mentioned (Supabase structure, tables, and data logic)?
